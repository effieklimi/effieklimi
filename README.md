I'm Effie, final year PhD student in transcriptomics/viral vectors/vascular disease at the University of Edinburgh. 

> **I work right where dry and wet lab meet;** both a computational biologist and a wet lab scientist. Working on simplifying the most used analyses in biology down to requiring the most minimal input possible from the user.


#### 📦 Two packages currently in the works... more to come soon ⏳

> I am looking for machine learning engineers and web developers interested in biology to automate science and build products with! If that is you, [contact me](mailto:hey@effie.bio)!
