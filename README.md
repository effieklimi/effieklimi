### 👋 [effie.bio](effie.bio)

I like thinking about automatic scientific thinking and practice.

Working on simplifying the most useful analyses in biology down to requiring the most minimal input possible from the user.
- Two packages currently in the works... more to come soon

Always looking for web developers and machine learning engineers interested in biology to automate science and build products with! If that is you, message me!
