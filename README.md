### 👋 

I like thinking about automatic scientific thinking and practice.

Working on simplifying the most useful analyses in biology down to requiring the most minimal input possible from the user.
	📦 Two packages currently in the works... more to come soon ⏳

#### Always looking for web developers and machine learning engineers interested in biology to automate science and build products with! If that is you, message me!
