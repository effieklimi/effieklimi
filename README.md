### 👋✨💜🧬🔬

I'm Effie, final year PhD student in transcriptomics/miRNA biology/viral vectors/vascular disease at the University of Edinburgh. 
**I work right where dry and wet lab meet;** both a biology techie and a wet lab scientist, so I am trying to harmonise the transition from wet to dry lab by making analyses user friendly and ELI5-level. 


Working on simplifying the most useful analyses in biology down to requiring the most minimal input possible from the user.
	📦 Two packages currently in the works... more to come soon ⏳

#### Always looking for web developers and machine learning engineers interested in biology to automate science and build products with! If that is you, message me!
